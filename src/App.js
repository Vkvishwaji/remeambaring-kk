          Kunnath's leap of faith to switch cities would eventually bless
          Indians with one of <br />
          the most lovable singers of the ‘90s.

          In 1994, Delhi resident Krishnakumar Kunnath packed his bags and
          shifted to Bombay. His pregnant wife Jyothy <br /> Krishna accompanied
          him as the couple looked forward to the husband establishing a career
          as a singer.

            ‘Aayi aisi raat hai jo bohot khushnaseeb hai. Chahe jise door se
            duniya, woh mere kareeb hai.’
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <p className="text-center">
            Two months after the couple reached Bombay, Kunnath found himself in
            the studio of music composer Lesle Lewis.
          </p>
          <p className="text-center">
            Lesle, who kept a slim Hulk Hogan moustache and a ponytail, had
            invited Kunnath to his newly-built studio <br /> Purple Haze on the
            recommendation of music partner Hariharan.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond composing music for films, Lewis was also producing jingles
            for advertisements during that period.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            After finishing recording for a jingle, and not really sure if Lewis
            had liked his voice, Kunnath went to the <br /> washroom. He could
            hear Lewis speak outside to someone on the phone. He heard Lewis say
            '..he is damn good..."s
          </p>
          <br />
          Kunnath was sure they were talking about him; he punched the air in
          joy. He had got the break he wanted.

            tujhe.’
          </span>{" "}
          <br />
          In the next few years, Kunnath would not just sing 3,500 jingles in 11
          different languages but also some of the <br /> biggest hits Indians
          would hum.

          In 1996, Vishal Bhardwaj, who was then a music director, got Kunnath
          to sing a portion of the song 'Chhod Aaye <br /> Hum' in Gulzar's
          Maachis. Three years later, Kunnath would hit stardom he never
          imagined.

            Sony Music International had just entered the Indian market and was
            looking for a debut artiste. With mentor <br /> Lesle Louis by his
            side, Kunnath launched his debut album 'Pal' with Sony Music in
            1999.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          And, India got her KK. <br /> The songs 'Pal' and 'Yaaron' from KK's
          album struck the chord with Indians, especially the college-going
          youth. An <br /> entire generation would grow up singing the songs.

          KK's journey continued. He sang songs for films and also performed in
          concerts. He belted out many more hits, <br /> including 'Tadap Tadap'
          from Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam,'Kya Mujhe Pyaar Hai' from Woh Lamhe,
          'Aankhon Mein <br /> Teri' from Om Shanti Om, ‘Zara Sa’ from Jannat.

          <br />
          KK sang all types of song, ensuring he wouldn't be typecast. He kept

          <br />
          As an individual, KK maintained a humble outlook despite the success.
          A family guy, he'd value his privacy and <br /> candidly described
          himself as 'asocial'.

          Hours before he passed away, he did what he loved the most. He was
          performing on stage. He sang the song <br /> 'Pal' one last time. The
          truth in the words ‘Hum rahe ya na rahe kal, kal yaad ayenge yeh pal,’
          hit home the same <br /> night.
